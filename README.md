"# Wikimedia" 

My personal crack at a Wikimedia data science assignment. See for assignment: https://github.com/wikimedia-research/Discovery-Hiring-Analyst-2016
The data is provided in the url and I downloaded it to a local dir and set that path as working dir.  

This is also the first instance I use Github to do versioncontrol.
